# Prepare a Presentation

Prepare a VERY simple recap of what we did and what we learned in today's class in Node Week 1.

The presentation should last between 60 and 120 seconds

Time yourselves - that is NOT much time!

Next class we will be presenting to each other to share what we have learnt.

NOTE: Slides (or presenting from computer) is NOT allowed.
